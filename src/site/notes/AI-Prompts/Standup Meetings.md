**Individual Updates**
For each team member:
- **Tasks Completed**: Specific accomplishments since the last meeting
- **Current Tasks**: What they're actively working on with specific system, service, or infrastructure component details
- **Planned Tasks**: What they intend to work on next
- **Impediments/Blockers**: Any issues preventing progress (technical problems, dependencies, other issues)
- **Support Needed**: Specific help requested from other team members or other business teams

**Technical Discussions**
