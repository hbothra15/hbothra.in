**How to Use One External Keyboard Seamlessly with Both macOS and Ubuntu**

If you're someone like me who uses **macOS for work** and **Ubuntu Linux for personal projects**, you've probably faced a common annoyance ‚Äî **keyboard layout differences** between the two systems. It becomes especially frustrating when trying to use a **single external keyboard** across both platforms.

Good news ‚Äî there's a simple fix!

### üí° The Hack to Make macOS and Ubuntu Keyboard Layouts Compatible

While browsing for solutions, I stumbled upon this helpful [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puedY8fciy0) that saved me a ton of time.

The main issue usually lies with the **Command (‚åò)** and **Option (‚å•)** keys on macOS, which don‚Äôt align with the **Alt** and **Super** (Windows) keys on Linux-based systems. The trick is to **remap modifier keys** in macOS to mimic the Ubuntu layout.

### üîß Steps to Remap Keys on macOS:

1. Open **System Settings**
    
2. Navigate to **Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts**
    
3. Click on **Modifier Keys**
    
4. Swap the **Option** and **Command** keys

Once you do this, your keyboard will behave more consistently across both systems ‚Äî no need to mentally remap keys every time you switch!

### üîÅ Want to Revert the Changes?

If you ever want to reset your keyboard to its default configuration, simply delete this preference file:

```bash
/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist
```

And you're back to a fresh setup!

**Pro Tip**: Use **one external keyboard for both macOS and Linux** without confusion ‚Äî a game-changer for dual-OS users and developers.
